# AuditQL
This project is for a fictional auditing company. Using GraphQL on a Node, Express, and MongoDB based back end with React, Apollo, and Styled Components on the front end, it allows users to assign auditors to various audit projects and define their parameters.

## How to Use
To start the server, type 'node app' (or 'nodemon app' if you have nodemon installed) in the server folder.

Once the server is running, you can perform queries and mutations at the following url: http://localhost:4000/graphql

The front end can be starting by typing 'npm start' in the client folder. You will need to type 'npm install' in the folder first to download dependencies.
