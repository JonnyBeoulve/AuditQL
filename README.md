# AuditQL
This project is for a fictional auditing company. Using GraphQL for API definition on a Node, Express, and MongoDB based back end with React and Apollo on the front end, it will allow users to assign auditors to various audit projects and define their parameters.

## How to Use
To start the server, type 'node app' (or 'nodemon app' if you have nodemon installed) in the server folder.

Once the server is running, you can perform queries and mutations at the following url: http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Programming
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB
* GraphQL

## Notes
The back end for this project works locally, using a sandbox MLAB account for storing MongoDB documents. Feel free to run the project locally and perform queries and mutations at the link available in the How to Use section.
